Meter Data Location: https://lilcortexbucket.blob.core.windows.net/public/meters.json

Application Overview:
Modelling team is looking to visualize data from smart meters. The meters have geographic information as well as demand associated with each meter. The modelling team wants to be able to select individual meters on a map and visualize the average demand at every hour. The modelling would also appreciate it if you could identify which average demand is above the threshold using a threshold line (shown in the mockup) and/or chaging the colour of the points above the threshold
